# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from The Odin Project's Foundations course. It's a basic recipe website built with HTML to practice fundamental web development skills.

## Project Description

This website contains a main index page with links to several recipe pages. Each recipe page includes:
- A recipe image
- Description of the dish
- List of ingredients
- Step-by-step cooking instructions

## Skills Demonstrated

- HTML structure and semantics
- Creating links between pages
- Using lists (ordered and unordered)
